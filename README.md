# computer_vision_project

• Developed a Python script using OpenCV to preprocess images, extract features, and classify them using various machine learning techniques.
• Implemented image preprocessing functions for grayscale conversion, brightness adjustment, and resizing to dimensions of 200x200 and 50x50.
• Extracted SIFT features from images using OpenCV's SIFT algorithm and saved them as descriptors.
• Created grayscale pixel histograms with 64 bins, normalized them, and saved histogram images.
• Implemented and evaluated four distinct training and classification processes, including k-NN with raw pixel values (50x50), k-NN with SIFT features, k-NN with histogram features, and SVM with a linear kernel using SIFT features.
